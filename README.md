### Project Description
The Travel Itinerary Planner is an interactive web application that helps users create customized travel itineraries based on their chosen destination, travel dates. It suggests popular attractions, accomodation and must try food spots to enhance the travel experience.

### The Problem statement
Trip planning is time-consuming and overwhelming. Existing methods lack personalization, overlook hidden gems, and fail to adapt to travelers' moods and interests, leading to less fulfilling experiences.

### The Solution
Bye bye to boring travel plans!! Our interactive travel planner crafts the perfect itinerary, guiding you to must-visit spots, cozy stays, and delicious local eats. Plus, enjoy a dynamic background that changes with every destination‚Äîbecause your adventure should look as exciting as it feels!
